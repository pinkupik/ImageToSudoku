Empty Sudoku Grid Display Module for Streamlit GUI.

This module provides functionality to display an empty 9x9 Sudoku grid
using Streamlit components. The display creates a blank, read-only grid
that can be used as a placeholder or initial state before puzzle detection
and solving operations.

Key Features:
- Empty 9x9 grid display with disabled input fields
- Consistent visual styling with other grid components
- Streamlit container-based layout management
- Read-only presentation for display purposes
- Uniform cell formatting and spacing

The module serves as a visual placeholder in the application workflow,
typically shown when no puzzle has been detected or processed yet.
