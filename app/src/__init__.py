Core Processing Package for Sudoku Detection and Solving System.

This package contains the fundamental processing modules that handle the core
functionality of Sudoku detection, digit recognition, and puzzle solving. It
implements the computer vision and mathematical algorithms that power the
application's main capabilities.

Modules:
    suddet: Computer vision-based Sudoku grid detection and extraction
    sudscan: OCR-powered digit recognition and scanning
    sudsolve: Mathematical solving algorithms and backtracking

Key Features:
- Advanced image processing and computer vision techniques
- Perspective transformation and grid extraction
- OCR integration with PaddleOCR for digit recognition
- Multiple solving algorithms (backtracking, constraint propagation)
- Optimized performance for real-time processing
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

The src package serves as the algorithmic core of the application, providing
robust and efficient implementations of all major processing operations
from image analysis to solution generation.

Dependencies:
- OpenCV for computer vision operations
- NumPy for efficient array processing
- PaddleOCR for digit recognition
- PIL for image manipulation
